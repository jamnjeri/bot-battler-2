# BOT-BATTLR
==========================

## DESCRIPTION
**Bot Battlr** is a mini web application that allows a user to custom build their own Army.

The API link generated by my json server was:
[http://localhost:3000/bots](http://localhost:3000/bots)

* Then install the various packages from package.json `npm install`
* Create environment variables
* The data used in this project can be found at [data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EWN0qLfAWfgzO1N2P8H5WmrsTx0nMkhp3s-rXVESTNA/edit)

### GET STARTED

## PROJECT DELIVERABLES
For this challenge, I worked on Bot Battlr, a mini web application where you can browse through a list of bots and select which one you would like to join your army.

The user, is expected to be able to:

* See profiles of all bots rendered in `BotCollection`.
* Add an individual bot to your army by clicking on it. The selected bot should render in the `YourBotArmy` component. Each bot can only be enlisted once.
* When a bot is selected from the collection to join your army, it doesn't      disappear from the `BotCollection`.
* Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the
  `YourBotArmy` component.
* Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked
  "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the
  `YourBotArmy` on the frontend.

### Bonus Deliverables
The user should be able to:
* Choose if I want to enlist a bot into my army or just see their data. Clicking
  on the card should instead display a show view (`BotSpecs`) for that bot,
  which should replace `BotsCollection`. BotSpecs should have two buttons: one
  to go back to the list view and another to enlist that bot. 
* Sort bots by their health, damage or armor. For this, create a new component,
  `SortBar`.
* When I enlist a bot it will be **removed** from the `BotCollection` and added
  to `YourBotArmy`.
* Filter bots by their class. We can select a few filters at the same time.
*  Sort bots by their health, damage or armor. For this, create a new component,
  `SortBar`.
* Only enlist **one** bot from each `bot_class`. The classes are
  `["Support", "Medic", "Assault", "Defender", "Captain", "Witch"]`.

### CONCLUSION
* All the Core project Deliverables were achieved as well as some of the bonus deliverables.
* It is important to note that enlisting the bot means it will be deleted even from the API.

### Languages used to create this project
* React,
* HTML,
* CSS,
* JavaScript
